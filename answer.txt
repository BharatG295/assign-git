    These files may include the files which are different for every computer configration or which nit be needed to
     get updated for functioning of Project.

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A) When we have a branch (say "branch1") other then master branch with changes not divergent from master branch,
  (i.e, new branch is ahead additions to master, not removing anything from master), the merge created from
  master branch and branch 1 will be fast forward with all the commits in branch1 added to ahead of old master branch
  in linear fashion 

Why should you have different branches?
A) We need different branches for following reasons:
	* It helps in ongoing development without disturbing main branch. This helps in keeping a working copy and
	  still developing testing in another branch
	* It helps all the team working parallely on their own development area with main branch being intact and add
	  finalized changes later
	* Prevents from making multiple copies of a project in your local system 

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A) One.
